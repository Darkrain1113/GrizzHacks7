# DOOM style 3d (raycasting) game in Python (based on Wolfenstein 3d)

# DOOM 3D - Learning Python using FPS games

This project was designed to bring together the worlds of gaming and programming. As gamers, we love board games, video games, and everything in between, and they all have something valuable to teach us. But what if we could merge that passion for games with the skills needed for programming?

In this project, we explore how first-person shooter (FPS) games can be used as a tool to teach Python programming. By walking through the game, you'll see how FPS games can be leveraged to engage and educate the next generation of programmers.

Game Controls:

> WASD keys for movement

> Mouse for aiming and interaction

>Goal: Play through the game and answer programming-related questions to progress! Each challenge is designed to help you learn Python while having fun.
